# TidyingAssignment
This repository includes the files for the Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

CodeBook.md contains a description of the data set, the variables meanings and possible values.
run_analysis.R contains the steps necessary to read the raw data set, process it according to the assignment instructions, and obtain the tidy data set.
tidy_dataset.txt contains the tidy data set.

Unzip that downloaded raw data set from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip in your working directory and make sure to set the working directory for RStudio also.
Run the run_analysis.R in your working directory. It will:
* read the training and testing data sets and their labels, activities descriptions, subjects file
* merge the training and test data sets
* select only mean and std columns
* rename columns
* group and join the data with activities and subjects
* tidy the data set by creating more columns with values described in the code book. It's a tall tidy data set.
